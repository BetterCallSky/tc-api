For this exciting challenge Razorfish is looking for the Topcoder Prototype community to help rapidly prototype the Social Jukebox application that will be used in their London offices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Right now in New York City Razorfish is hosting their customer Tech Conference and Blake Walles will be presenting your UI Prototypes on stage Wednesday September 23!</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this challenge we will not be creating every screen and every page for production. We will be creating prototype code (using best practices) to showcase the design, specific interactions and essentially allow users to &quot;test&quot; if the application makes sense to them (or does it need additional design iterations). Many Topcoder clients are looking to &quot;rapidly&quot; prototype designs for quick user testing and iteration and now you have a chance to showcase your skills!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

  "finalSubmissionGuidelines": "<p><strong>About the Application</strong><br />\nThe Social Jukebox Application is a fun way for employees and guests of the Razorfish office to play their favourite music over shared speakers in different &quot;zones&quot; or areas of the Razorfish office. The application will use i-Beacon technology to access employee and guests music playlists and pull their favourite tracks from Spotify and other music applications to generate an office playlist.</p>\n\n<p>Users will have the opportunity to be &quot;guest&quot; DJs and help shape the track order and overall playlist, and Razorfish guests will be given VIP status and their music will be moved to the front of the playlist.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to being a fun social jukebox, the application will alert Razorfish front desk employees when a client has arrived at the office and will relay meeting room information and times to the office guests.</p>\n\n<p>The application will also track the mood or &quot;sentiment&quot; of the employees who are in a particular zone of the office displaying whether they are in a good mood, sad mood, upbeat, or the general emotion associated with the type of music that is being played. This will display for each zone in the office.<br />\nWe just completed this initial design (fellow TCO15 Prototype Finalist Chekspir was the designer) and now we are looking to create a quick prototype!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Details</strong><br />\n- For this challenge you only need focus on Mobile layout for iPhone.<br />\n- We would also like to view the application using Chrome browser<br />\n- All possible linkable pages should link to each other.<br />\n- For your submission you just need focus on spec stated below<br />\n- Provided storyboard created on iPhone 6 size (Retina and 750px), your submission need support other size like iPhone 4, 5 and 6+ using best practices of Responsive Web solution.<br />\n- We should be able to trigger the navigation to get back to the Dashboard, logout etc (to reset the flow)<br />\n- Pay attention to all small details, let us know if need clarifications.<br />\n- Match similar fonts in your submission.
