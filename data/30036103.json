PROJECT OVERVIEW</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p>People are exposed to many man-made chemicals throughout their lives. These include food ingredients and additives, pesticides, cosmetics, medicines, cleaners, solvents, etc.&nbsp; Historically, a series of standard animal studies have been used as a means to evaluate&nbsp;whether a chemical can cause a range of different adverse effects and at what dose these effects occur.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;systemic toxicity&rdquo; is often used because the effects can occur in different organ systems such as the liver, kidney, lungs, or reproductive system. The systemic Lowest Effect Level or LEL is the&nbsp;lowest dose that shows adverse effects in these animal toxicity tests.&nbsp;&nbsp; The LEL is then conservatively adjusted in different ways by regulators to derive a value that can be used by the Agency to set exposure limits that are expected to be tolerated by the majority of the population.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, every chemical to which we are exposed would have a well-defined LEL.&nbsp;However, the full battery of animal studies required to estimate the LEL costs millions of dollars and takes many months to complete.&nbsp; As a result, thousands of chemicals lack the required data needed to estimate an LEL. To help fill this gap, the EPA has screened nearly 2,000 chemicals across a battery of more than 700 biochemical and cell-based&nbsp;<em>in vitro&nbsp;</em>assays to identify what proteins, pathways, and cellular processes these chemicals interact with and at what concentration they interact. The goal of this challenge is to develop an algorithm using data from high-throughput&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;assays, chemical properties, or chemical structural descriptors to quantitatively predict a chemical&rsquo;s systemic LEL.&nbsp; Chemicals causing toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (a common mechanism for neurotoxicity) are excluded from the challenge since they may skew the LEL values and can be identified in other ways.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span class=\"small_info_spec\" id=\"rswDetailedRequirements\"><strong>2. ToxCast Project Background</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p>In 2005, the federal government launched&nbsp;<a href=\"http://epa.gov/ncct/Tox21/\" target=\"_blank\">Tox21,</a>&nbsp;an initiative to use&nbsp;<em>in vitro&nbsp;</em>high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify what proteins, pathways, and cellular processes chemicals interact with and at what concentration they interact. The screening data will be used to more cost-effectively and efficiently prioritize the thousands of chemicals that need&nbsp;<em>in vivo&nbsp;</em>toxicity testing and, in the future, predict the potential toxicity of chemicals.&nbsp; Tox21 currently pools the resources and expertise of EPA, National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences/National Toxicology Program, National Institute of Health/National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and the Food and Drug Administration&nbsp;to screen almost 10,000 chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>One of EPA&rsquo;s main contributions to Tox21 is the Toxicity Forecaster or ToxCast for short. The first phase of ToxCast was designed as a &ldquo;proof-of-concept&rdquo; and was completed in 2009.&nbsp; It evaluated approximately 300 chemicals in over 500 biochemical and cell-based&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>HTS assays. The 300 chemicals selected for the first phase were primarily data rich pesticides that have a large battery of&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;toxicity studies performed on them. Data collection on the second phase of ToxCast was completed in 2013. It evaluated approximately 1,800 chemicals in an expanded set of over 700 biochemical and cell-based&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;HTS assays.&nbsp; The 1,800 chemicals were from a broad range of sources, including industrial and consumer products, food additives, and potentially &quot;green&quot; substances that could be safer alternatives to existing chemicals. These chemicals were not as data rich as those selected for the first phase and many do not have&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;toxicity studies.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<em>in vitro&nbsp;</em>data are accessible through the interactive Chemical Safety for Sustainability Dashboard (iCSS) and raw data files are also posted to the Dashboard web page. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;HTS data, the EPA has created a complementary Toxicity Reference Database (ToxRefDB), which captures the&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;animal toxicity studies that have been performed on the ToxCast chemicals.&nbsp; For the first time, it provides detailed chemical toxicity data covering over 30 years and $2 billion in animal testing, in a publicly accessible and computable format.</p>\n\n<p>In traditional toxicology,&nbsp;a series of standard animal studies&nbsp;are used&nbsp;as a means to evaluate&nbsp;whether a chemical can cause a range of different adverse effects and at what dose these effects occur.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;systemic toxicity&rdquo; is often used because the effects can occur in different organ systems such as the liver, kidney, lungs, or reproductive system. The systemic Lowest Effect Level or LEL is the&nbsp;lowest dose that shows adverse effects in these animal toxicity tests.&nbsp;&nbsp; The LEL is then conservatively adjusted in different ways by regulators to derive a value that can be used by the Agency to set exposure limits that are expected to be tolerated by the majority of the population.&nbsp;However, as stated above, many chemicals do not have the animal studies required to derive an LEL.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6em;\">3. CONTEST OVERVIEW</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are launching a search and mine the internet idea generation challenge to identify a specific combination of <em>in vitro </em>assays which could be used in an algorithm to predict the <em>in vivo </em>systemic LEL.&nbsp; The combination of <em>in vitro </em>assays may include additional assays based on previous scientific studies to supplement those that already exist within ToxCast.&nbsp; Our vision is to use the combination of assays in a marathon match and provide members with different options for identifying subsets of high-throughput screening assays to use in models to predict a chemical&rsquo;s LEL on an administered dose basis and across all classes of endpoints, but excluding chemicals that cause toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (a common mechanism for neurotoxicity).&nbsp; We have opted for idea generation format because we are looking for different options (ideas) from online sources for determining relevant high-throughput screening assays and to figure out the existing LELs predicted by animal toxicity studies. This&nbsp;is an open-ended search where we do not have any specific restrictions and we want as many ideas as you can propose to do such a modeling.&nbsp; Part of the idea should incorporate a process to extrapolate from a biologically active concentration in an <em>in vitro</em> assay to an administered LEL dose. Please remember that we are looking for a listing of relevant high-throughput screening assays, scientific studies and listing of LELs generated from animal toxicity studies which can be used further as a part of bigger software/algorithm and not something that is embedded deep inside some tool which has no way to be reusable for another component.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"small_info_spec\" id=\"rswDetailedRequirements\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"small_info_spec\" id=\"rswDetailedRequirements\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>4. SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Please submit a document describing all found high-throughput screening assays, scientific studies and/or listing of the systemic LELs for chemicals from animal toxicity studies. Also explain how you think this information will be useful in developing an algorithm for using high-throughput screening data to predict systemic LELs, but excluding chemicals that cause toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (a common mechanism for neurotoxicity). Part of the explanation should include the process used to extrapolate from a biologically active concentration in an in vitro assay to an administered LEL dose, and note if one or more of your identified in vitro assays is particularly relevant to more than one endpoint.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Please provide complete information about the input to the library and output. Also, give details about the format of data used by library.</li>\n\t<li>Please support your findings with examples.
