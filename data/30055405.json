  "detailedRequirements": "*** The original challenge updated company_apps.utilization, for this challenge we want to update each user.utilization to have the number of matching stats for the user_id. ***<br />\n<br />\nCloud Hub is tracking utilization (or stats) data against the applications each company is using. We want to add to the nightly job to roll up the data in user_stats and add it to each company_app.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Project Overview</strong><br />\nCloud Hub is trying to help their client solve the problem of knowing what software applications they are spending the most money on over time. Cloud Hub will take in data from credit cards and other sources and attempt to show what software the client has purchased and who is using the applications the most.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Requirements</strong><br />\n1. Add to dailyStats function to calculate number of logins for current month. This would grab count of records from user_stats for a company_app and store that in company_apps.utilization.<br />\n2. Remove db.update_monthly_stats and refactor code to update all stats with db.update_nightly_stats<br />\n3. Add function to demoService to generate a random number of user_stats for each app and user. Today there is code that fakes this number with a range of number of users (2-20).&nbsp;",
