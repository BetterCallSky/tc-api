  "detailedRequirements": "<p>Topcoder is helping a client develop an internal crowdsourcing solution -- CrowdExchange. &nbsp;Publishers in this community will create Stories and Activities in the system which represent software development tasks which need to be completed. &nbsp;Members, the software developers, will log into the system, search to find activities they are interested in, and register to complete the tasks. &nbsp;After registering, a Member will submit zip files containing their submissions and the Publishers will review and score the work completed. &nbsp;In some ways, this community will work very much like Topcoder itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In previous challenges, we&#39;ve laid a lot of the groundwork for this application. &nbsp;We&#39;ve developed <a href=\"http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30050453/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true\" target=\"_blank\">Apex-based services</a> for creating and maintaining Stories and Activities. &nbsp;We&#39;ve also developed <a href=\"http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30050600/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true\" target=\"_blank\">workflow code</a> to manage the lifecycle of a task as it moves to completion. &nbsp;And last, but certainly not least, our topcoder design and prototype community has produced a <a href=\"http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30050184/?type=design&amp;noncache=true\" target=\"_blank\">very appealing design</a> and <a href=\"http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30050547/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true\">web site</a> for this application. &nbsp;Now, we&#39;re going to put all the pieces together and a create a Salesforce.com Community Site by taking the given designs and implementing the functionality captured in the html pages. &nbsp;You will be using AngularJS, Javascript, Visualforce and Apex to tie the current prototype to the Force.com platform. &nbsp;Our first Stories and Activities challenge has laid the groundwork for our Single Page Application and we&#39;ll be moving forward with that programming idiom.</p>\n\n<p>In this challenge you are responsible for implementing the following html pages in Visualforce/Apex:</p>\n\n<p>1. member-dashboard.html&nbsp;<br />\n2. member-member-profile.html<br />\n3. member-my-profile.html<br />\n4.&nbsp;publisher-dashboard.html<br />\n5. publisher-member-profile.html<br />\n6. publisher-my-profile.html</p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n\n<p>Members and Publishers are going to be identified by a field on the User Object: &nbsp;Crowd_Exchange_User_Type__c. &nbsp;The values here will be: None, Member, or Publisher. &nbsp;There will be Permission Sets associated with each of the user types. &nbsp;There are several junction tables which are critical for managing data related to skills which are highlighted on the Profile pages and Dashboards. &nbsp; We have User Skills, Activity Skills, and Internal Project Skills which handle the many to many relationships between Skills and the Users, Activities, and Internal Projects. &nbsp;Members will search for Activities by querying for relevant Activity Skills and likewise publishers will search for candidate developers &nbsp;by looking for Members will relevant User and Internal Project Skills.</p>\n\n<p>Our milestones and Activity Statuses have been updated since these html prototypes where prepared. &nbsp; We now have the following milestones:</p>\n\n<p>Publish Date -- date that activity is made public and is visible to members and other publishers on the site.<br />\nStart Date -- date that activity is available for registration<br />\nRegistration Date -- due date for member registration<br />\nAssignment Date -- due date for publisher to assign a registered member to activity<br />\nSubmission Date -- due date for assigned member to submit code&nbsp;<br />\nReview Date -- due date for publisher to review submission<br />\nAcceptance Date -- date the publisher accepts submission<br />\nEnd Date -- date the activity is either completed or canceled.</p>\n\n<p>All pages - You should implement the header and footer of each page as common components that can be included in all the pages listed. &nbsp;The links to the Help, Search, Notifications as well as the footer links can be dead links for now since those pages haven&#39;t been created yet. &nbsp;You should implement the links for the Dashboard and My Profile pages in the header.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">You should use the html prototypes found in the proto2v28.zip for the Profile page. &nbsp;There have been significant updates to these pages. &nbsp;The html pages/prototypes found in the Stories and Activities zip for the Profile pages are out of date.</span></p>\n\n<p>member-my-profile.html<br />\n<span>1. &nbsp;You should implement edit mode and the drag and drop functionality for the profiles pictures and background header.<br />\n2. &nbsp;You should implement the internal projects, current activities, and completed activities tabs. &nbsp;The completed activities should have scores.</span></p>\n\n<p>publisher-my-profile.html<br />\n1. &nbsp;All four tabs should be implemented: Active Stories and Activities, Completed, Developers and Technology Used.<br />\n2. &nbsp;Under the Active Stories and Activities tab and the Completed tab &quot;Stage&quot; should be updated to Phase.<br />\n3. &nbsp;You should implement edit mode and the drag and drop functionality for the profiles pictures and background header.</p>\n\n<p>publisher-dashboard.html<br />\n1.&nbsp;The information on the infographics at the top of the pages will be populated nightly by a batch apex job (not part of this challenge). &nbsp;You can query for that data in the Summary_Data__c object. &nbsp;<br />\n2. &nbsp;The data for Top Technologies graphic at the bottom of the page can be found in the <span>Member_Skill_Snapshot__c</span> object. &nbsp;The data in this object will be also be populated by a batch apex process.</p>\n",
