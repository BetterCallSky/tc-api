Project Overview</strong></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>The EPA is a U.S. federal government agency devoted to safeguarding the environment. One of the EPA&#39;s great concerns is the proliferation of cyanobacterial harmful blooms (cyanoHABs) in the nation&#39;s lakes. The following resources provide information on what cyanoHABs are and how they threaten the environment. </span></span></p>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:square\">\n\t<li><span><span><a href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/cyanobacterial-harmful-algal-blooms-cyanohabs\">EPA: Cyanobacterial Harmful Blooms (CyanoHABs)</a></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDOLdF0PnA0\">University of North Carolina: Cyanobacteria [video]</a></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span><span>The TopCoder project on cyanoHABs aims to develop an algorithm that will be deployed in an Android app with mapping and data visualization capabilities. The app will inform local and federal policy makers about locations where bloom events are likely to occur, allowing them to concentrate their efforts in those areas.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 0)\"><strong>2. Contest Overview:</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p>As a part of this project, we have four main modules in the system:</p>\n\n<p>1.) Admin Website Module</p>\n\n<p>2.) Data Management Module</p>\n\n<p>3.) Back-end Module</p>\n\n<p>4.) Front-End Module</p>\n\n<p>In the initial design and development cycle, we designed the architecture of all four modules and also completed the assemblies of the first two modules - Admin Webiste and Data Management Module (done by you).</p>\n\n<p>On completing that, we realized that there were many differences between the designs and so we recenly ran an architecture sync challenge.</p>\n\n<p>In that challenge, the task was to take all the foru moudules and update each one of them independently to make them compatible to each other. We have concluded the contest.</p>\n\n<p>Our next step is to complete the development of the remaining two assemblies - Back-end and Front-end.</p>\n\n<p>But before doing that, we would like to port the changes made in the architecture of already developed assemblies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your task in this contest is make those changes. Specifically, the input to this contest will be ARS, System Architecture and the newly updated module archiitectures. Also, you will be provided the data management module and admin website assemblies. You need to look thorugh the architecture designs to see what has been updated from previous versions and make those updates in respective assemblies.</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Please note: This is not an integration task. We just want you to make the updates to the two modules in such a way that integration at later stage becomes easier. But you will still submit two separate assemblies for those modules - with all the required updates done in them</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8B4513\">Please ask immediately in forums if something is not clear and we will be happy to help promptly.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
