  "detailedRequirements": "<p>The client wants to develop an application that would help them with scheduling people (i.e. qualified technicians) and equipment, to specific job sites (i.e. locations) for a given duration of time. In other words, the client needs an application that would allow it to manage, schedule, and track resources (such as technicians and/or equipment), their engagement, qualification, and availability. They want to have this information at their fingertips though a well-designed application which the client prefers to be web-based.</p>\n\n<p>The client has people and equipment that cover jobs all over the country. Since no location has sufficient resources to meet peak demands (and the ability to predict the peak demand is rather difficult,) the number of requests for services from customers will vary greatly during the year. &nbsp;<br />\nWhen a location is in need of extra resources, the local (i.e. for that location) supervisor will usually need to acquire and schedule the needed resources from amongst multiple locations. &nbsp;Sharing of these resources amongst locations is very common but quite challenging.</p>\n\n<p>This application will provide the complete technician scheduling solution.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>In this F2F contest, we require the competitors to update some UI bugs.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>The required bugs are:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-96</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-101</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-108</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-126</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-142</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-144</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-147</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-149</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-152</li>\n\t<li>https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/TST-153</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>If you don&#39;t have the JIRA project access, please post a thread in the forum to ask for accessing permission.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The existing code base is in the svn, the solution svn address is in</strong> <a href=\"https://coder.topcoder.com/tcs/clients/hades/applications/technician_scheduling_tool/trunk/\">https://coder.topcoder.com/tcs/clients/hades/applications/technician_scheduling_tool/trunk/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>All the competitor should send email to support@topcoder.com to request svn read access.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I will also attach the svn code, <span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>the winner will be responsible to merge the code to svn.</strong></span></p>\n",
