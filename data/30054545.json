  "detailedRequirements": "Cloud Hub is looking to add a couple of features to our web application. In a previous challenge we added token refresh and expiration. This works great when moving from one tab to another, but there isn&#39;t a check when the initial tab or window is opened. We need to check for a valid token when the page is initially loaded. If you close the tab, wait over an hour and open the site again you get an empty invalid state for the dashboard. Once the refresh is triggered, it should log out the user. Another feature we want to add is redirect after login. If the user is logged out or is coming from an email link, we want to take them to the specific page after login.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Project Overview</strong><br />\nCloud Hub is trying to help their client solve the problem of knowing what software applications they are spending the most money on over time. Cloud Hub will take in data from credit cards and other sources and attempt to show what software the client has purchased and who is using the applications the most.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Requirements</strong><br />\n1. Check for token status on page load. If expired/invalid logout the user.<br />\n2. When logging out the user, add current page to &quot;loc&quot; parameter and append this data to url. For example: /login?loc=activity<br />\n3. On login if URL has a loc param, redirect the user to that specific page instead of the dashboard.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;",
