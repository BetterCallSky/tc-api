In this contest, you will need to verify the App &amp; Roles ARS (Specification) document for the new SCRD web application to make sure it includes all the required functionality from the existing legacy system. &nbsp;Basically, we need your help to determine if there are any holes or discrepancies in the ARS document.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this Part 1 Bug Hunt, you should verify the App and Role ARS&nbsp;document against the Wireframes and Storyboards (<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">storyboards take precedence over the wireframes since they are the most recent)</span>.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Project Background:</strong></em><br />\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has an existing legacy application called the Service Credit Redeposit/Deposit System (SCRD). The mission of the Service Credit Redeposit/Deposit System (SCRD) is to compute deposits and redeposits, create an initial bill, post payments, and send out receipts to federal employees for periods of federal employment service that were either not covered by retirement deductions (deposits), or were covered and later refunded by the federal government (redeposits).</p>\n\n<p>For this project, OPM will be building a new&nbsp;web application&nbsp;to replace the existing legacy SCRD system.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c00000;\"><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Contest Objective</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>With this contest, we need to determine if there are any holes or discrepancies in the ARS (Specification) doc. &nbsp;The most important task for this bug hunt is to figure out where the ARS is missing functionality, or contains incorrect or insufficient details. &nbsp;In other words, places where the ARS does not provide definition or detail for functionality that is currently included in the legacy application and should be in the new SCRD web application &ndash; e.g. functionality, data validation, error processing, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The two challenges for this Bug Hunt are to determine if the App and Role ARS document includes either of the following:</p>\n\n<p>1. The current uses cases are incorrect or lack sufficient detail to implement them.<br />\n2. The ARS document is&nbsp;missing use cases or requirements.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><font color=\"#0000ff\"><b>Valid Bug Definition</b></font></p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">For this contest, only bugs that meet one of the following 2 conditions will be considered a valid bug:</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Any ticket that accurately describes a current use case that is not sufficiently detailed (for example, something that is inferred, but not backed up with information).<br />\n2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Any ticket that cites a section/functionality within one of the source documents, and then explains that no current use case addresses that section/functionality from the source document.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, we&#39;ll need you to look for items in the current documentation and compare it to the App &amp; Role ARS document. &nbsp;Specifically, for Part 1 you should look&nbsp;for missing functionality or incorrect /&nbsp;insufficient details between the ARS document and the&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Wireframes and Storyboards (</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">storyboards take precedence over the wireframes since they are the most recent).</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PART 1 SCOPE</strong>: Please note, this is <strong>Part 1</strong> in a series of similar bug hunts. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Part 1, you should verify the App and Role ARS&nbsp;document against the wireframes and&nbsp;storyboards</strong>. &nbsp;The&nbsp;storyboards take precedence over the wireframes since they are the most recent.&nbsp; Any bugs reported for this contest but based on other verification sources will NOT count towards your total for this contest.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>Contest Guidelines</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The guidelines for this contest are given below:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>As issues are identified they need to be logged in JIRA:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/OPMBH\">https://apps.topcoder.com/bugs/browse/OPMBH</a>&nbsp;(<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">when creating a bug you MUST select the &quot;ARS Bug Hunt - Part 1&quot; component)</span></li>\n\t<li>Issues must include clear descriptions, test cases and steps to reproduce and expected vs. actual results in order to be counted.</li>\n\t<li>First competitor to find an issue gets credit, duplicates will not be counted.</li>\n\t<li>Reviewers will accept, reject or mark the issues as duplicate.</li>\n\t<li>Please DO take a look at the reported bugs, duplicated bugs cost your work time and the reviewer&#39;s time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;

If it&#39;s less obvious if it is the same issue or not, use your best judgment and the reviewers will do the same.</li>\n\t<li>Put an eye on the issues being submitted by other members to minimize the time you may be spending on duplicate efforts. Knowing what has already been reported will allow you to better focus your time on finding yet undiscovered issues.</li>\n\t<li>Double check your steps to reproduce and test cases to make sure they are clear. Make sure your steps include creation of any necessary data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#B22222;\"><strong>Submission Deliverables</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>You need report your issues in JIRA. Please submit a text file contains the bugs you reported to OR.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#B22222;\"><strong>Final Submission</strong></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For each member, the final submission should be uploaded to the Online Review Tool.</li>\n\t<li>You must not include any identifying information, such as your handle, in your submission.
