  "detailedRequirements": "<h3>Overview</h3>\n\n<p>The client (GBG) is looking for the community to develop a monitoring system that collects data (e.g. performance metrics/statistics data) from laptop/desktop computers, and provides a cloud-hosted administrative console for admin users to query/visualize data collected in real time. Based on the statistics/metrics data, administrators may make decisions regarding new laptops, additional memory, software patches and upgrades, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The system will consist of a few different sub-systems - the Time Series Database to receive and persist metric data, the Agent that runs on client laptop/desktop computers for collecting local data and sending to Time Series Database, as well as direct integration with HBase on the server, for storing data that isn&#39;t time sensitive, like what programs are installed on a given computer, the hardware properties for a computer, etc...</p>\n\n<p>An Agent will be deployed on a variety of computers, including servers, laptops, and desktops, and will run in background to periodically collect system diagnostic/statistical metric data (CPU/memory utilization, etc.). The collected data will be sent to a small web service that parses the payload and puts the data in the appropriate data store, either OpenTSDB or directly into HBase.</p>\n\n<p>We have completed a proof of concept that shows how to grab a small subset of the required data and pass it to OpenTSDB. We are now going to run a series of F2Fs to formalize the application to make it easy to install and run and to make the data collection more expansive.</p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:13px; line-height:1.2\">.NET Client Code</span></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/PGProactiveDeviceMonitoring/PGDMWindowsClient/\">https://gitlab.com/PGProactiveDeviceMonitoring/PGDMWindowsClient/</a></p>\n\n<p>We will target Windows 7+</p>\n\n<p>Please target the latest version of Visual Studio Express and use C# for the implementation</p>\n\n<p>If you need code access, register for this F2F and then request access in the forum for this F2F (*NOT* in the public development forum) with your Gitlab username. You will be given&nbsp;<em>read</em>&nbsp;access.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you receive a 404 error when hitting the Gitlab link, it means you do NOT have access. Please request access in the F2F challenge forum. Within 24 hours you will receive an email from Gitlab that states you have access. This is NOT an automatic process - it is handled manually.</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Building Code</h3>\n\n<p>There will be a README.md file here that explains test accounts and how to build, run, and configure the app. Please read this documentation carefully as it covers a lot of different pieces of information.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/PGProactiveDeviceMonitoring/PGDMWindowsClient/blob/master/README.md\">https://gitlab.com/PGProactiveDeviceMonitoring/PGDMWindowsClient/blob/master/README.md</a></p>\n\n<h3>F2F description</h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:times; font-size:medium\">Please see the Gitlab ticket for the detailed requirements: &nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/PGProactiveDeviceMonitoring/PGDMWindowsClient/issues/1\">https://gitlab.com/PGProactiveDeviceMonitoring/PGDMWindowsClient/issues/1</a></p>\n",
