You must not edit the bug report once created, so make sure you enter all the details at the time you create the issue, otherwise your issue will be move to the end of the queue. If you really need to edit an issue you must use comments section for this (i.e. add a comment to describe any changes you want to make to the issue), and we&#39;ll decide whether the changes are major enough to move the issue to the end of the queue. You are allowed to add screenshots in the comments section though, assuming your issue report contains all the details when created.</span></p>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>Important Notice:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You must also be the first person to report the issue and submit it while submission phase is open.&nbsp; github will allow you to file issues before and after the submission phase, but these will NOT be counted.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(178, 34, 34)\"><strong>Contest Prize Eligibility</strong></span></p>\n\n<div>\n<p>The submitter with the most accepted bugs will win the contest.</p>\n</div>\n",

Also, make sure your bug reports are reasonably general.<br />\nIf you submit the same bug that is seen in multiple screens, for instance, you will likely only get credit for the original bug report.

If it&#39;s less obvious if it is the same issue or not, use your best judgment and the reviewers will do the same.<br />\n2.&nbsp;Put an eye on the issues being submitted by other members to minimize the time you may be spending on duplicate efforts. Knowing what has already been reported will allow you to better focus your time on finding yet undiscovered issues.<br />\n3.&nbsp;Double check your steps to reproduce and test cases to make sure they are clear. Make sure your steps include creation of any necessary data.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(192, 0, 0)\"><strong>Submission Deliverables</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>You need report your issues in github. Please submit a text file contains the bugs you reported to OR.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(192, 0, 0)\"><strong>Final Submission</strong></span><br />\nFor each member, the final submission should be uploaded via the challenge detail page on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.topcoder.com/\" style=\"text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; cursor: pointer; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: 1.6; background: 0px 0px;\">topcoder.com</a>.<br />\nYou must not include any identifying information, such as your handle, in your submission.
