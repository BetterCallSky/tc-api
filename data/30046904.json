  "detailedRequirements": "<p>The client wants to develop an application that would help them with scheduling people (i.e. qualified technicians) and equipment, to specific job sites (i.e. locations) for a given duration of time. In other words, the client needs an application that would allow it to manage, schedule, and track resources (such as technicians and/or equipment), their engagement, qualification, and availability. They want to have this information at their fingertips though a well-designed application which the client prefers to be web-based.</p>\n\n<p>The client has people and equipment that cover jobs all over the country. Since no location has sufficient resources to meet peak demands (and the ability to predict the peak demand is rather difficult,) the number of requests for services from customers will vary greatly during the year. &nbsp;<br />\nWhen a location is in need of extra resources, the local (i.e. for that location) supervisor will usually need to acquire and schedule the needed resources from amongst multiple locations. &nbsp;Sharing of these resources amongst locations is very common but quite challenging.</p>\n\n<p>This application will provide the complete technician scheduling solution.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 0)\"><strong>In this F2F challenge, we require the competitors to fix the reported bugs.</strong></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We attached a ppt which has the issues to be fixed (only slide 1 and slide 4 are in scope of this challenge).</li>\n\t<li>The competitors are expected to fix the slide 1 issue and the same issue happens in slide 4.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>If you don&#39;t have the JIRA project access, please post a thread in the forum to ask for accessing permission.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The existing code base is in the svn, the solution svn address is in</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coder.topcoder.com/tcs/clients/hades/applications/technician_scheduling_tool/trunk/\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\">https://coder.topcoder.com/tcs/clients/hades/applications/technician_scheduling_tool/trunk/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>All the competitor should send email to support@topcoder.com to request svn read access.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The competitor are expected to fix all the back end code issues which cause the reported bugs regardless whether it is the designer&#39;s fault.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 0)\"><strong>The winner will be responsible to merge the code to svn and deploy the latest code to the VM.</strong></span></p>\n",
