  "detailedRequirements": "<p>*CCA*</p>\n\n<p>This bug race is under CCA, as is the code for the application. &nbsp;You can access the private forum here:</p>\n\n<p>http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Category&amp;categoryID=16973</p>\n\n<p>You must request access to the forum to be granted access.</p>\n\n<p>* TESTING*</p>\n\n<p>In the course of testing PCDVR, please do not test with the &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; album. &nbsp;This is a special album that&#39;s shared across all accounts and is being used to help provide a place for beta testers to see some cool videos. &nbsp;Please don&#39;t use it for the testing of deletion or moving as people are working hard to populate it.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Please also ensure that all test images and videos are &ldquo;business appropriate&rdquo; and professional. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve had some mildly inappropriate content uploaded recently and need to ensure that doesn&rsquo;t keep happening.</p>\n\n<p>*GENERAL UI REQUIREMENTS*</p>\n\n<p>You must ensure that support for both landscape and portrait screens are supported, as well as iPad and iPhone, 1x and Retina (@2x)</p>\n\n<p>Any new PNG files must be compressed. &nbsp;Please use this site:</p>\n\n<p>http://tinypng.org/</p>\n\n<p>*RUNNING THE APP*</p>\n\n<p>Run the &ldquo;My Media Development&rdquo; &nbsp;target from Xcode on a device or in the simulator. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the configuration.plist - you&#39;ll find two new parameters:</p>\n\n<p>PCDVRAuthGuid</p>\n\n<p>PCDVRCredentials</p>\n\n<p>The credentials are for testing the login page, since the login page won&#39;t actually work in the simulator. If you load the app and run it in the simulator, it should just work. You just have to login with the configured test credentials instead of &quot;real&quot; credentials</p>\n\n<p><br />\n*SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS*</p>\n\n<p>Your submission should contain *only* the changed files, and each change in those files should be wrapped in comments that reference the bug race number for this particular bug race, to make merging as easy as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you download the code from the forum regularly, as it will be updated while bug races run to ensure that the latest is available.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>*ISSUE:*</p>\n\n<p><br />\nApp crashes, If the user tries to export files from device2 which are deleted from device1 before sync up</p>\n\n<p>Steps to Reproduce (incl. applicable code versions) -</p>\n\n<p>1. Launch the app and login<br />\n2. Navigate to Home Media Screen with device1 and device2<br />\n3. Select multiple media files from device1 and delete them<br />\n4. Select the same files from device2 and tap on export to camera roll, as soon as delete operation is completed</p>\n\n<p>Actual Results:<br />\nApp crashed (Logs attached)</p>\n\n<p>Expected fix:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>When this happens, just display a popup in the app&#39;s style that says &quot;Export failed because file has been deleted&quot;</li>\n\t<li>After the user hits &quot;OK&quot; in the popup, refresh the files in the visible album</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Environment:<br />\nIOS App Version: 1.0.9.9</p>\n",
