The tool will allow potential clients of the company to ask questions and chat with the company.</span></p>\n\n<p>The goal of this project is to build a responsive, HTML5-based Location Based Analytics application. This app will parse through data from several inputs (Wi-Fi, social media, mobile, etc.) and integrate it with transactional information to generate analytics on customer traffic and movement throughout a retail location. With this data the user can optimize customer interactions and operations, and can unlock the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Onsite Insights: A better understanding of customer profile and his/her behavior within a retail location</li>\n\t<li>Dynamic Targeting: Market specific products based on the profile of the customer and his/her behavior patterns</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Essentially, a user (store manager, marketing professional, etc.) will be able to use this app to monitor visitors/customers within a retail location. They can see where users are within that location as well as view their transaction data (what they are buying, how much, etc.). This in turn gives the user great insights into their customers and allows them to directly target specific customers or groups of customers with specific advertisements and promotions directly related and of interest to them. The Location Based Analytics app is the dashboard and tool to monitor that data and initiate those advertisements.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c00000\"><strong>Contest Objective</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>The goal of this competition is to test the application UI. You should focus on testing the functions as well as usability. If there&rsquo;s some intuitive usability issue you find, please do submit that (ie: &ldquo;I tried to go back to the home screen but there was no way to do that from this screen&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>The basic guidelines for this contest are given below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span>As issues are identified they need to be logged in GitLab.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Issues must include clear descriptions, test cases and steps to reproduce, and expected vs. actual results in order to be counted.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>First competitor to find an issue gets credit, duplicates will not be counted.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Reviewers will accept, reject, or mark the issues as duplicate.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Please DO take a look at the reported bugs, duplicated bugs cost your work time and the reviewer&#39;s time.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Important Notice: &nbsp;You must also be the first person to report the issue and submit it while submission phase is open. &nbsp;Any bugs submitted outside of the submission duration will not be counted.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Please focus on functional testing. We do not want bug reports on typos, spelling errors, content spacing, and any other content-related trivial issues; all such issues will be rejected and will not count.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Please also submit standard usability issues (ie: usually apps allow you to interact a certain way, this one doesn&rsquo;t)</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 255)\"><strong>What To Test</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Please see the screenshots below, the areas in red rectangles need to properly tested.</p>\n\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.topcoder.com/direct/launch/downloadDocument?documentId=27520351\" style=\"height:565px; width:1024px\" /></div>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.topcoder.com/direct/launch/downloadDocument?documentId=27520353\" style=\"height:587px; width:1024px\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.topcoder.com/direct/launch/downloadDocument?documentId=27520352\" style=\"height:596px; width:1024px\" /></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Target Platforms</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>This application was designed to work on a tablet and have a touch-friendly user interface.

In short, the best way to show the bug!</li>\n\t\t<li>Expected results after the bug is fixed</li>\n\t\t<li>Current results, before the bug is fixed</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 153, 0); background-color: rgb(221, 255, 221); padding: 10px; margin: 5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">&nbsp;<strong>Important Notice:</strong></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If you do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;properly document your bug reports, they will likely be rejected due to lack of information or documentation. Also, make sure your bug reports are reasonably general.</li>\n\t<li>If you submit the same bug that is seen in multiple screens, for instance, you will likely only get credit for the original bug report. The others will all be closed as duplicates.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>How to Log Tickets</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create an account on GitLab: <a href=\"http://www.gitlab.com\">http://www.gitlab.com</a></li>\n\t<li>Go to this URL to join the project group: <a href=\"https://tc-ragnar.herokuapp.com/ragnar/groups/5613f730d601610e000f21bd/290824\">https://tc-ragnar.herokuapp.com/ragnar/groups/5613f730d601610e000f21bd/290824</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Search for and register your GitLab handle to join the project</li>\n\t<li>Read the wiki:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/lba-visualization/application/wikis/bug-hunt\">https://gitlab.com/lba-visualization/application/wikis/bug-hunt</a></li>\n\t<li>Visit the app here: <a href=\"http://54.172.8.51/lba\">http://54.172.8.51/lba</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Log issues in the correct place: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/lba-visualization/application/wikis/bug-hunt\">https://gitlab.com/lba-visualization/application/issues</a></li>\n\t<li>View and Submit Issues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Scoring</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Scoring will be based on the number of bugs, weighted by severity. &nbsp;Be sure to correctly attach a severity label to your bug. &nbsp;The co-pilot has the right to change a severity at their discretion.</p>\n\n<p>Scoring is inverse to severity: P1 = 5points, P2 = 4points, P3 = 3points, P4 = 2 points, P5 = 1point</p>\n\n<p>The member with the highest score will win 1st place. &nbsp;The member who gets the 2nd most points will win $100.</p>\n\n<p>For submitters who submit but don&#39;t take first, if they submit bugs that aren&#39;t covered in the by either prize mentioned above, they will receive $5 for other accepted bugs up to a $200 grand total. &nbsp;All bugs outside of the first and second place awards are subject to the co-pilot&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">If two submitters submit the same bug report, the submitter who submitted the report first into GitLab will get credit for the bug. The second submitter will not.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><span><strong>Tips</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Some of the tips helpful for the contest are:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Submitting what is obviously the same issue multiple times with small variations will only annoy the reviewer that has to sort through all the issues and will only count as one issue anyway. If it&#39;s less obvious if it is the same issue or not, use your best judgment and the reviewers will do the same.</li>\n\t<li>Keep an eye on the issues being submitted by other members to minimize the time you may be spending on duplicate efforts. Knowing what has already been reported will allow you to better focus your time on finding yet undiscovered issues.</li>\n\t<li>Double check your steps to reproduce and test cases to make sure they are clear. Make sure your steps include creation of any necessary data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c00000\"><strong>Submission Deliverables</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>For each ticket you fix, upload text file with link to gitlab merge request to Online Review, we will need this to pay you.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c00000\"><strong>Final Submission</strong></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For each member, the final submission should be uploaded via the challenge detail page on <a href=\"http://www.topcoder.com\">topcoder.com</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",
