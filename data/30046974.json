  "detailedRequirements": "<p><em>If you remember back on our rapid prototype we had an file uploader that you could configure to use local file storage via FS and S3 file storage via knox. &nbsp; We have been using it in local mode and noticed that the S3 mode was not quite complete. &nbsp; As we move over to our new framework we need to bring over the S3 middleware controller and configure the callback to set the challenge.files relationship once the file has been uploaded and the uploadstatus has returned the s3 filepath.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong><br />\n1. &nbsp;Checkout out the code base from this repo: https://github.com/appirio-tech/lc1-challenge-app, at the current time this master is still pulling from the JSON data but that is ok for this challenge.<br />\n2. &nbsp;Create a directory called upload in you app root (otherwise you will get a 500). &nbsp; Then goto http://localhost:8000/edit/#/challenges/10/edit and add a file (don&rsquo;t forget the big blue + to start the upload). &nbsp; The goal of this challenge is to switch this to S3 via a config setting.<br />\n3. &nbsp;You will notice that node config has been installed and we should start using that. &nbsp; &nbsp;I will supply some S3 keys in the form to add to the default.js config file (DO NOT POST THESE KEY/SECRET anywhere in github) &nbsp; I will delete them after the challenge but they should still not find there way into git. &nbsp; You are welcome to use a node-config local.js file to store them and add to .gitignore.<br />\n4. &nbsp;Look back at the rapid prototype repo (https://github.com/appirio-tech/lc1-project) and get &nbsp;packages/challanges/server/middleware/S3UploadMiddleware.js S3 storeage provider and drop it into the lc1-challenge-app /server/routes. &nbsp; &nbsp;Note the S3UploadMiddleware is just a stock client and the callback is not configured. &nbsp;It should behave exactly like the localUploadMiddleware handleUpload, &nbsp; and this will &nbsp;be the meat of this challenge.<br />\n5. &nbsp;You should follow the config pattern from the rapid prototype repo ( https://github.com/appirio-tech/lc1-project) &nbsp;to be able to switch between local storage and S3.<br />\n6. &nbsp;You submission should be able to upload challenge creation files to the forum provide S3 bucket even though current app master does not use the heroku challenge-service. &nbsp;I am not hoping this submission does not need to be highly refactored when we switch to &nbsp;the heroku service api, and that it not a difficult merge . You have some liberties to &lsquo;just make it work&rsquo; for this submission however if you take shortcuts or identify pitfalls with future migration in your solution please call them out in your submission doc.</p>\n",
