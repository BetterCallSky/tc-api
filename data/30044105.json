  "detailedRequirements": "<p>*CCA*</p>\n\n<p>This bug race is under CCA, as is the code for the application. &nbsp;You can access the private forum here:</p>\n\n<p>http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Category&amp;categoryID=16973</p>\n\n<p>You must request access to the forum to be granted access.</p>\n\n<p>* TESTING*</p>\n\n<p>In the course of testing PCDVR, please do not test with the &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; album. &nbsp;This is a special album that&#39;s shared across all accounts and is being used to help provide a place for beta testers to see some cool videos. &nbsp;Please don&#39;t use it for the testing of deletion or moving as people are working hard to populate it.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Please also ensure that all test images and videos are &ldquo;business appropriate&rdquo; and professional. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve had some mildly inappropriate content uploaded recently and need to ensure that doesn&rsquo;t keep happening.</p>\n\n<p>*GENERAL UI REQUIREMENTS*</p>\n\n<p>You must ensure that support for both landscape and portrait screens are supported, as well as iPad and iPhone, 1x and Retina (@2x)</p>\n\n<p>Any new PNG files must be compressed. &nbsp;Please use this site:</p>\n\n<p>http://tinypng.org/</p>\n\n<p>*RUNNING THE APP*</p>\n\n<p>Run the &ldquo;My Media Development&rdquo; &nbsp;target from Xcode on a device or in the simulator. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the configuration.plist - you&#39;ll find two new parameters:</p>\n\n<p>PCDVRAuthGuid</p>\n\n<p>PCDVRCredentials</p>\n\n<p>The credentials are for testing the login page, since the login page won&#39;t actually work in the simulator. If you load the app and run it in the simulator, it should just work. You just have to login with the configured test credentials instead of &quot;real&quot; credentials</p>\n\n<p><br />\n*SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS*</p>\n\n<p>Your submission should contain *only* the changed files, and each change in those files should be wrapped in comments that reference the bug race number for this particular bug race, to make merging as easy as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you download the code from the forum regularly, as it will be updated while bug races run to ensure that the latest is available.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>*ISSUE:*</p>\n\n<p>We are going to make the following fixes on the new media detection popup:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1) This popup should be global to app - showing on all screens when new media is detected. &nbsp;The only exception is if the user is already on the video upload screen.</p>\n\n<p>2) Screenshots taken while the app is running should trigger the popup</p>\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;New media/content recorded must be selected by default when the user clicks &quot;Continue&quot; in the new media popup. &nbsp;This was working, but has been reported as not working in the latest version</p>\n\n<p>The solution for new media should be refactored into a separate class, so that we limit the amount of redundancy for this solution. &nbsp;I&#39;ll be ensuring that the winning F2F submission is clear, concise, and well engineered.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
