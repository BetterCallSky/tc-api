  "detailedRequirements": "Cloud Hub is looking to solve an issue with hosting on AWS S3. Right now unicode characters are not displaying. We are trying to use&nbsp;u00d7&nbsp;to display X for a close window, and it works locally but not once it is deployed. We have tried to set the charset on the HTML, CSS, and S3 file. In the forum we will provide a screenshot of the issue and access to the code.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Project Overview</strong><br />\nCloud Hub is trying to help their client solve the problem of knowing what software applications they are spending the most money on over time. Cloud Hub will take in data from credit cards and other sources and attempt to show what software the client has purchased and who is using the applications the most.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;",
