Health Care Providers ).&nbsp; &nbsp;The one major difference is that the PoC had a 1:1 relationship between products and contacts in which called a &quot;sample request&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the production version the salesperson will actually fill out a &quot;bulk request&quot; which allows them to request products to multiple Health Care Providers (HCPs) at once.&nbsp; &nbsp; We now call this the &quot;Request Form&quot; and the combinations of products and contacts (also switching to accounts) will be known as the request_line_item.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8px\">Attached in the forum you will find the package for the new Salesforce schema (ksra.0.1.0.zip) &nbsp;which you will use. All objects start with the pseudo namespace schema &#39;KSRA&#39; (Korea Sanple Request App) &nbsp;or &#39;GLBL&#39; (for global).&nbsp; &nbsp;<em><strong>The primary objective of this challenge is to re-wire the PoC code base to use the new object schema</strong></em>.&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>The secondary objective of this challenge is to optimize the experience for an IPad.&nbsp;</em> &nbsp; We will be running a design challenge in parallel to get the final look at feel so this is not critical but if possible we like to utilize the addition screen space provided by a tablet.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition there will be a discretionary bonus of $500 to the winning submission if they also demonstrate a working version of the signature receipt.&nbsp; (See Bonus below)</span><br />\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8px\"><strong>1. </strong>&nbsp;Starting with<a href=\"https://github.com/kbowerma/twelveparsecs\"> this source code </a> modify the contacts tab to use the standard account instead. &nbsp;None of the final schemas for the objects have been finalized so make sure your solution has a good guide to change the fields in the Readme.md doc<br />\n\t<span style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8px\"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; The request tab will require a pretty major overhaul as described above. &nbsp;It should allow for the user to select 1 account and 1 product and add it to the request form(as a new now).&nbsp; &nbsp;This row should be stored in the request line item object (</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">KSRA_Request_Line_Item__c)</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8px\"><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong> Do your best to modify the experience so it optimized for an iPad.&nbsp; &nbsp;We don&#39;t care about the exact fields for now but just add a few &nbsp;more so it fills up the layout better.&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember the story goes like this:&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>As a sales rep I want an IPad form that I can add a combination of HCPs and products to be added to the form so that when the entire form (it may have multiple HCPs)&nbsp; gets approved by two users it will automatically create a receipt (singable invoice) for each HCP on the Form so I can deliver the drug and have them sign my IPad that they received the form.</em></span><br />\n\t<span style=\"font-size:11px\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">Here is a rough Idea of what the form might look like:</span></span><br />\n\t<br />\n<img width=\"1426\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-28 at 5 23 00 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1180747/14903341/09d424ac-0d66-11e6-8647-90cbd7d9f689.png\">\n\t<span style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8px\"><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp; <em><strong>Bonus</strong></em>:&nbsp; &nbsp;For this challenge we are only requiring the creation of the form and corresponding children line items, however if the selected winner goes the extra mile and creates the Receipt (1 for each HCP on the form)&nbsp; such that when the form is approved the receipt gets generated and synced down to the iPad with the finger signature there will be and extra $500 bonus.</span><br />\n\t&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ol>",

  "finalSubmissionGuidelines": "1. &nbsp; The provided github repo has the credentials to a shared demo org which also contains the objects provide In the form. &nbsp; You are free to go in there and look but please don&#39;t change any code in that demo org. &nbsp; Use your own dev org.<br />\n2. &nbsp;Provide your code in a single zip file and please include all of the original directory including the .git subdirectories so we can merge the code easier.<br />\n3. &nbsp;Provide detailed documentation of your solution based on the readme.md file in the source repo. &nbsp; You may modify this as your submission documentation (Forget that topcoder word file template or pdf format that you might be familiar with.<br />\n4. &nbsp;Provide a video of you submission in action. &nbsp; If you are not comfortable with spoke English you may annotate your video with text.<br />\n5. Optionally you may also want to include a video walk through (narrated) of your code. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is not required but it does help the judges do a better job of understanding your approach.<br />\n6. &nbsp;If you would like to attempt the bonus please include an additional file called bonus.md which explains how you did the receipt and what if anything sill needs to be done.<br />\n7. &nbsp;We understand this is an aggressive timeline which is why we made the receipt a bonus and have priced it higher than normal, however we think the requirements are fairly straight forward. &nbsp; This challenge is far from the finished project we are just hoping to take a large leap forward.<br />\n<br />\nI will put the other PoC challenges in the forum\n<ol><br />\n\t<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\nThanks and good luck<br />\n<br />\nkbowerma",
