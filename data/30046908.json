  "detailedRequirements": "<p><em>Until now our challenge app (non-meanio framework) has been using static json files for challenges. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the moment you have been waiting for. &nbsp; Wire it to the real api! &nbsp; &nbsp;However we are going to start with only the challenge create and challenge edit and we will do the listing in a follow up challenge. &nbsp;This means that you should try to only edit code in client/edit-challenge and avoid &nbsp;touch anything in client/manage-challenge if possible.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>First checkout out the app code from<strong> https://github.com/appirio-tech/lc1-challenge-app</strong> and run npm install. &nbsp; In the server directory you will see <strong>challenge-consumer.js</strong>. &nbsp; This is the swagger generated node client stub from our api service. &nbsp; The api service is hosted here http://lc1-challenge-service.herokuapp.com/docs/. &nbsp; (remove the docs path, to hit it directly) &nbsp; If you would like to re-generate this client stub you can run <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">grunt swagger-clients</span> which will call the heroku service to generate this node file. &nbsp; However it has been provided so you don&rsquo;t need to do this. &nbsp;But it is cool and you should try it. &nbsp; &nbsp;It will also generate the discussion consumer too from a different endpoint but we won&rsquo;t use that in this challenge. &nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements.</strong><br />\n1. &nbsp;Include the server/challenge-consumer.js file in the server/web.js and replace all the functionality from edit-challenge modules to write to the service instead of the console. &nbsp;<br />\n2. &nbsp;You will need to pass the domain to this consumer, http://lc1-challenge-service.herokuapp.com you should do this from a config file or env var but we will all you to hardcode it in one place since we do not have our node-config set up yet.<br />\n3. &nbsp;You should start with creating a challenge from the &lsquo;new challenge&rsquo; button and since we are not touching the manage challenge module you will need to hit the challenge-service endpoint (http://lc1-challenge-service.herokuapp.com/challenges) to see the challenge you have created. &nbsp;Feel free to look at the repo for the challenge service api if you need reference (http://lc1-challenge-service.herokuapp.com/challenges) &nbsp;there is a sample postman file in the docs dir that might be helpful (you will need the standalone postman app not the chrome extension to see the payload of the calls)<br />\n4. &nbsp;Once you have successfully created a DRAFT challenge (confirm from the GET call in #3) you should now be able to edit that challenge (by id) in the app by using the following URL: &nbsp;http://localhost:8000/edit/#/challenges/:challengeId/edit &nbsp; It should show you the app you have just created. &nbsp; (Be sure to put you handle in the title since we will all be using the same data). &nbsp; &nbsp;All the functionality of the edit page should work in your final submission. &nbsp;<br />\n5. &nbsp;The app has been changing rapidly we still have a couple of issues on this page that may be related to the static json file or maybe related to the merge of the last challenge. &nbsp; You should also address those and make note of what you did.<br />\n6. &nbsp;We have added some of our OAuth code but it is not working yet, so you will need to set two env vars to any value. &nbsp; <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">export TC_AUTH0_CLIENT=foo</span> and<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\"> export TC_AUTH0_SECRET=bar</span> in order for the app to start.</p>\n\n<p>In theory this challenge should be pretty easy. &nbsp; You are just rewiring POSTs and PUTs from displaying to the console to using a real endpoint and this controller is provided. &nbsp; However I am sure there are complications that I have not thought about. &nbsp; In additions we want good clean simple code, and we want it fast (5 days). &nbsp; So I am putting a higher than normal purse on this challenge to compensate. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Good luck, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span>I will be watching this challenge all weekend for posts &nbsp;but don&rsquo;t let an unanswered post slow you down. &nbsp; Take your best guess at what you think is the right way and note it in your submission doc.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span>kbowerma</span></p>\n",
