  "detailedRequirements": "Some customers of Cloud Hub won&rsquo;t have the most up-to-date information in their account every day. We have added a new time_machine_date to the company object and want to modify reporting to show 1 year from that date, instead of 1 year from today. We also need to update reporting endpoints and fix if an app doesn&#39;t have spend using the new date.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Project Overview</strong><br />\nCloud Hub is trying to help their client solve the problem of knowing what software applications they are spending the most money on over time. Cloud Hub will take in data from credit cards and other sources and attempt to show what software the client has purchased and who is using the applications the most.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Requirements</strong><br />\n1. Update db.get_company_apps_renewals to use flexible date range.<br />\n2. Update db.get_company_app_history to use flexible date range.<br />\n3. Fix issue if app doesn&#39;t have charges with new date range. db.get_total_spend_by_company_and_app doesn&#39;t return apps with 0 values. My example locally was vimeo and time machine of 5/31/16.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;",
